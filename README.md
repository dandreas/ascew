# A Simple Console Emulator for Windows
[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/dandreas/ascew/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/dandreas/ascew)

This is a simple shell (I didn't know the correct term at the time when I wrote this) which gives some basic improvements to the default Windows command line shell.
This release includes the following features:
* Configuration to change the color of the directory and input/output text
* Configuration to change the background color
* Aliases akin to bash's aliases, also configured in the configuration file
* Ability to change drives (main benefit when I wrote this)

## To Install

Get the files:
* For nightly builds clone the master or devel branch and check the bin directory
* For stable builds go to the release tab

Next:
* Copy ascew.exe, the libraries (dll files), and optionally the config file into the directory of your choice
* After that you're ready to go!
